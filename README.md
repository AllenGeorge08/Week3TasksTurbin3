## NFT MARKETPLACE

- A Marketplace must be made where assets are listed on-chain , the buyer can buy the assets and pay the sol which would directly go to the owner.  This eliminates the risk of scams and makes it easier for the user to navigate and make trades without worrying about unreasonable pricing, scams and lack of transparency while buying the NFT.

    3. Cleaner UI's and easy navigation for the users.
